# Simple-Number-Guessing-Game



# Tasks 

Scenario: You are a junior developer at a game development startup, and your team has 
been tasked with creating a simple text-based game using Python. The goal is to design an 
interactive number guessing game where players must guess a randomly generated number 
within a limited number of attempts. Since you are using GitHub Copilot, you want to 
leverage AI-assisted coding to speed up development and ensure best practices in your 
code.  
Your task is to develop the game in VS Code, utilizing inline comments and docstrings to 
guide Copilot in generating structured and optimized code. 


# Steps to be followed: 
  1. Set up the project 
  2. Generate a random number 
  3. Implement user input handling 
  4. Write the game logic 
  5. Test the game
